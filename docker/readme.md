The docker environments and containers for the ACE system are still a work in progress but should be useable in the next several weeks.

The intent is to have a completely containerized build environment inside the container mounted over a local volume, thus allowing a developer to edit the source files with any tools they wish and not have to worry about setting up compile dependencies.
